# victauri-watchdog

Lightweight crash-recovery sidecar for the [Victauri](https://github.com/runyourempire/victauri) MCP server.

Since Victauri's MCP server runs inside the Tauri app process, a crash kills the server too. The watchdog runs as a separate process, detects failures, and can trigger recovery.

## What It Does

- Polls `GET /health` on the Victauri MCP server at a configurable interval
- Logs warnings on first failure, errors after consecutive misses
- Executes a configurable recovery command after threshold failures
- Resets failure count automatically when the server recovers

## Installation

```bash
cargo install victauri-watchdog
```

## Usage

```bash
# Default: poll localhost:7373 every 5 seconds
victauri-watchdog

# Custom port and interval
VICTAURI_PORT=8080 VICTAURI_INTERVAL=10 victauri-watchdog

# With recovery command (runs after 3 consecutive failures)
VICTAURI_ON_FAILURE="systemctl restart my-tauri-app" victauri-watchdog
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VICTAURI_PORT` | `7373` | Port to poll for health checks |
| `VICTAURI_INTERVAL` | `5` | Seconds between health checks |
| `VICTAURI_MAX_FAILURES` | `3` | Consecutive failures before recovery action |
| `VICTAURI_ON_FAILURE` | _(none)_ | Shell command to execute on failure threshold |

The recovery command fires once per failure cycle. If the server comes back, the counter resets.
