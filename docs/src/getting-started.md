# Getting Started

Get Victauri running in your Tauri app in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Tauri 2.0+ application
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- An MCP client (Claude Code, VS Code, or any MCP-compatible tool)

## Step 1: Add the Dependency

Add `victauri-plugin` to your app's `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
victauri-plugin = "0.5"
```

The plugin must be a regular dependency (not `[dev-dependencies]`) because it runs inside your app process. In release builds, `init()` returns a no-op plugin with zero overhead — no feature flags needed.

## Step 2: Initialize the Plugin

Add `victauri::init()` to your Tauri builder in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(victauri_plugin::init())
        // ... your other plugins and setup
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

That's it. In debug builds, this starts an MCP server on `127.0.0.1:7373`. In release builds, it's a no-op.

## Step 3: Add Capabilities

Add the `victauri:default` capability to your app's capabilities file. Create or edit `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`:

```json
{
  "identifier": "default",
  "windows": ["*"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "victauri:default"
  ]
}
```

Without this capability, the Tauri permission system silently blocks IPC callbacks and the plugin cannot interact with your webviews.

## Step 4: Connect via MCP

Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root (`victauri init` writes this for you):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "victauri": {
      "command": "victauri",
      "args": ["bridge", "--wait"]
    }
  }
}
```

This connects through the **`victauri bridge`** — a stdio proxy that discovers the running
app's port at connect time, re-discovers it across restarts, and reads the auth token
automatically from the discovery directory. Because the port is resolved dynamically, the
agent always reaches the right app — even after a rebuild, or when several Victauri apps are
running. (Requires the CLI on your `PATH`: `cargo install victauri-cli`.)

### Multiple apps running at once

Pin the bridge to a specific app by its Tauri bundle identifier — `victauri init` bakes this
in automatically when it can read your `tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "victauri": {
      "command": "victauri",
      "args": ["bridge", "--wait", "--app", "com.your.app"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

Auth is **enabled by default** (the token is auto-generated and auto-discovered — the bridge
reads it for you, so no manual header is needed). To pin a fixed token for CI, set it on the
builder with `.auth_token("…")` (or the `VICTAURI_AUTH_TOKEN` env var).

> Connecting with a raw `"url": "http://127.0.0.1:7373/mcp"` also works, but it hardcodes a
> port — if that port is taken (another app, a leftover instance) your agent can silently bind
> the *wrong* app. Prefer the bridge.

## Step 5: Verify It Works

With your app running, check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7373/health
# Returns: ok

curl http://127.0.0.1:7373/info
# Returns: {"name":"victauri","port":7373,"protocol":"mcp","version":"0.7.3",...}
```

Or use the Victauri CLI:

```bash
cargo install victauri-cli
victauri check
```

## Optional: Register Commands

To enable command discovery and ghost command detection, annotate your Tauri commands with `#[inspectable]` and register them:

```rust
use victauri_plugin::inspectable;

#[inspectable(description = "Greet a user", intent = "greeting")]
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(victauri_plugin::init())
        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
        .setup(|app| {
            victauri_plugin::register_commands!(app, greet__schema());
            Ok(())
        })
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .unwrap();
}
```

## Optional: REST API

All 34 tools are also available via a REST API without MCP session overhead:

```bash
# List available tools
curl http://127.0.0.1:7373/api/tools

# Execute a tool directly
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7373/api/tools/eval_js \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"expression": "document.title"}'
```
