# Chrome Extension

The `victauri-browser` crate provides MCP access to **any website** running in Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Arc — not just Tauri applications.

## What It Does

The Chrome extension + native messaging host extends Victauri's inspection capabilities to regular web pages. An AI agent can connect via MCP on `localhost:7474` and get DOM snapshots, interact with elements, evaluate JavaScript, inspect styles, and more — all on arbitrary websites.

This is useful for:
- Web scraping with semantic understanding
- Cross-site testing workflows
- Automating web tasks that span both Tauri apps and web services
- General browser automation via MCP

## Installation

### 1. Install the Native Host Binary

```bash
cargo install victauri-browser
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo build -p victauri-browser --release
```

### 2. Register the Native Messaging Host

```bash
victauri-browser install
```

This registers the native messaging host manifest with your browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Arc are auto-detected). The manifest tells the browser how to launch the native host when the extension requests it.

To uninstall:

```bash
victauri-browser uninstall
```

### 3. Load the Chrome Extension

1. Open your browser's extension management page (`chrome://extensions`)
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extensions/chrome/` directory from the Victauri repo

### 4. Connect via MCP

The native host starts an HTTP server on `localhost:7474` (with fallback to 7475-7484 if the port is busy).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "victauri-browser": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7474/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

The communication flow:

```
MCP Client (Claude Code)
    │
    │ HTTP (localhost:7474)
    ▼
Native Host Binary (victauri-browser)
    │
    │ Chrome Native Messaging (stdio)
    │ 32-bit LE length prefix + UTF-8 JSON
    ▼
Extension Service Worker (MV3)
    │
    │ chrome.tabs.sendMessage()
    ▼
Content Script (ISOLATED world)
    │
    │ CustomEvent (__victauri_command / __victauri_response)
    ▼
JS Bridge (MAIN world)
    │
    │ Direct DOM access
    ▼
Web Page
```

### Components

**Native Host Binary** (`victauri-browser`)
- Dual role: HTTP server for MCP clients AND native messaging host for Chrome
- axum router serves `/mcp` (MCP protocol), `/api/tools` (REST), `/health`, `/info`
- Reads/writes Chrome native messaging format on stdio
- `BridgeDispatch` sends UUID-tagged commands and resolves responses via oneshot channels

**Service Worker** (MV3 background script)
- Manages native messaging connection lifecycle
- Routes commands to the correct tab's content script
- Handles tab lifecycle (creation, removal, navigation)
- Captures screenshots via `captureVisibleTab` (no `debugger`/CDP permission)

**Content Script** (ISOLATED world)
- Relay between service worker and MAIN world bridge
- Uses `CustomEvent` pattern to cross the world boundary
- Injected into all pages matching the extension's permissions

**JS Bridge** (MAIN world, 1700+ lines)
- Full DOM inspection, interactions, accessibility, performance
- Same Playwright-grade actionability checks as the Tauri plugin bridge
- CSS inspection, recording, element finding, scroll, hover, click

## Available Tools (20)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_plugin_info` | Extension version and status (handled locally) |
| `tabs.list` | List open browser tabs (handled locally) |
| `dom_snapshot` | Full accessible DOM tree of active tab |
| `find_elements` | Search by CSS selector, text, or role |
| `eval_js` | Evaluate JavaScript in page context |
| `click` | Click an element by ref |
| `fill` | Set input value |
| `type_text` | Type characters one-by-one |
| `press_key` | Dispatch keyboard event |
| `hover` | Hover over element |
| `scroll_into_view` | Scroll element into viewport |
| `get_styles` | Computed CSS for an element |
| `get_bounding_boxes` | Element dimensions and box model |
| `highlight_element` | Draw debug overlay |
| `clear_highlights` | Remove all overlays |
| `screenshot` | Capture visible tab as PNG |
| `navigate` | Go to URL |
| `get_cookies` | Get cookies for current domain |
| `get_console_logs` | Captured console entries |
| `get_network_log` | Fetch/XHR request history |

## Authentication

The native host supports Bearer token authentication:

```bash
# Set via environment variable
VICTAURI_AUTH_TOKEN=my-token victauri-browser serve
```

Security features:
- Constant-time token comparison
- Token-bucket rate limiter
- Security headers on all responses
- Origin guard (blocks non-localhost origins)

## Port Behavior

Default port: `7474`. If busy, tries `7475` through `7484`. The `victauri-browser serve` command prints the actual port on startup.

## Tab Management

The extension tracks tab state (URL, title, bridge readiness). Commands are sent to the **active tab** by default, or you can target a specific tab by ID using the `tab_id` parameter where supported.

Special behaviors:
- Navigation uses `chrome.tabs.update()` (not content script `window.location`) for reliability
- Cookies use `chrome.cookies.getAll()` for httpOnly access
- Screenshots use Chrome's `chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab()` API
