# It does NOT replace CI, and is deliberately not the publish gate:
#   * cross-platform bugs (macOS/Linux) can only be caught by CI's matrix — e.g. 0.7.4
#     shipped a macOS-only discovery bug that no Windows run could see;
#   * the real-app E2E (a live demo-app) is a separate CI job;
# so the release workflow refuses to publish unless the FULL CI is green for the commit
# (the `require-ci-green` job). Preflight just makes the fast failures fast.
